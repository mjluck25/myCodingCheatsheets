# Web Accessibility

## Contrast

- Enhancing contrast in _Headings_, _Font Choices_ and _Color_ can help us ensure that our site is accessible to users with vision impairments.

#### Headings accessibility

- proceed with the heading Hierarchy (h1 to h5).

#### Text accessibility

- Using ***real text*** instead of text within graphics provides a website with several key benefits:

  - screen readers can _transform_ the text into a _voice-over_
  - users can _scale_ or _magnify_ the text for better legibility without losing image quality
  - itâ€™s _less taxing on the browser to load_ real text versus requesting large image assets from a server.

##### Color(background) and text

- high contrast between text and background.
- a ratio of at least **4.5:1** should be used on all standard text sizes.
- lighter color must have four and a half times the luminance of its paired darker color.
- A ratio of at least **3:1** should be used for larger text sizes.

##### Font size accessibility

- The standard font size for most modern web browsers is **16 pixels**.

#### Color accessibility

- contrast between elements in the foreground and those in the background.
