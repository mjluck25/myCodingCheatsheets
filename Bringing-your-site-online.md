## WireFrames

- low fidelity sketch of a digital interface.
- communicate how a designer intends to lay out the product.
- __emphasize usability__ over aesthetics.
- allow developers to __provide feedback__ on the design.
- are like _blueprints_.
- omit implementation details.
- are created before mockups in the design process.
- developers _breakdown_ wireframes __into__ a __development plan__.

## From Design to Website

- think __grid__ (underlying structure as grids).
- think __visual hierarchy__ which inform the user experience.
  - locate the _focal points_ (main, header, nav-bar, footer, etc.)
- think __visual continuity__ or visual cohesion.
  - can be achieved through _color_, _type_ and through adding _similar sections_ to our site.
  - we keep this in mind as we build our css.
- web design workflow:
  - gather your content(images, text, video files).
  - make design decisions
    - we decide what colors to use.
    - choose between images.
    - edit text and choose typography.
  - add a style guide (this informs our html and css).

Process:

- Take _one section_ at a time.
- Allow HTML and CSS to inform your layout.
- look for _similarities_ and _differences_ as you begin to choose HTML tags and CSS selectors.
- apply and build your _style guide_.
- be open to change.
