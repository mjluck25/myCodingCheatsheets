Node.js
--> a JavaScript runtime for building server-side or desktop applications.

--> allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.

--> can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

--> is written in C, C++, and JavaScript, and it is built on the open-source V8 JavaScript engine which also powers JS in browsers such as Google Chrome. As V8 supports new features in JavaScript, they are incorporated into Node.
