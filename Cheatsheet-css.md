# CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

- responsible for styling the Web
- _HTML_: Structure while _CSS_: Layout, Look
- General syntax: selector `{property:value;property:value}`

## Three ways to use CSS

1. **Inline CSS**

   - most basic but not that used
     > ie. `<h1 style="color:red"></h>`
   - it overwrites internal and external css style

2. **Internal CSS**

   - better to use than inline but lacks flexibility in working with multiple pages
   - within the head element:
     > ie. `<style> element1{designated:style} element2</style>`
   - it overwrites external style

3. **External CSS**
   - better in working with multiple files
   - create a `.css` file inside the folder
   - add in the head element:
     - we use the `link` element to link the HTML and CSS files together
       > `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
     - `rel` attribute: describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file.
     - `href` attribute: acts like an anchor element and describes the path or address to the CSS file.

Comment

- `/* */`

Important

- it overrides any style no matter how specific it is.
- useful when working with multiple stylesheets
- syntax: `property: value !important`

---

### ***CSS Rule/Syntax***

> ie. e1 {color:red; font-size: 3rem;}

- SELECTOR: `e1` where we select an element and inputs a style for that element
- DECLARATION BLOCK: everything enclosed by the curly braces `{}`
- DECLARATION: the group name for a `property:value` pair that applies a style to the selected element
- PROPERTY: visual characteristic of the element to be modified (ie. `color` and `font-size`)
- VALUE: value of the property (ie.`red` and `3rem`)
- always end with semicolon per `property:value` pair

#### **Grouping Selectors**

> ie. h1 and h2 --> h1, h2 {}

- use a comma (without space) per element to be grouped and styled

#### **Type Selector**

- selects the type of the html element that you would like to style
- such as `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `body`, etc.

#### **ID Selector** (`#`)

- selects the value of an `id` attribute within an element
- always starts with hash sign before the given id attribute value
- id's should always be unique
  > ie. html: `<h1 id="title">Title Book</h1>`
  > css: `#title {property:value;}`
- can only have a single value

#### **Class Selector** (`.`)

- selects the value of an `class` attribute within an element
- always starts with dot sign before the given class attribute value
  > ie. html: `<h1 class="green">Title Book</h1>`
  > css: `.green {property:value;}`
- can add multiple classes separated by a space

#### **Descendant and Child Combinators**

- syntax for descendant: `ancestor/parent descendant{block of code}`
- syntax for direct children: `ancestor/parent > child{block of code}`

#### **Attribute Selector**

- matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute

Existence (`element[attr]`)

- Matches a specific attribute (whatever its value).

Equality (`element[attr="value"]`)

- matches a specific attribute with specific value.

Space (`element[attr~="value"]`)

- matches a specific attribute whose value appears in a space-separated list of words.

Prefix (`element[attr^="value"]`)

- matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string.

Substring (`element[attr*="value"]`)

- matches a specific attribute whose value contains a specific substring.

Suffix (`element[attr$="value"]`)

- matches a specific attribute whose value ends with a specific string.

`element[attr|="value"]`

- Represents elements with an attribute name of `attr` whose value can be exactly `value` or can begin with `value` immediately followed by a hyphen, `-` (U+002D). It is often used for language sub-code matches.

Universal Selector (`*`)

- least amount of specificity
- we use this whenever we want to reset a default browser style
- usually used for:
  > box-sizing: border-box;
  > margin: 0;

Pseudo class Selector (`:`) [see also](#pseudo-classes)

- keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
- most common pseudo class:
`:focus`
`:visited`
`:hover`
`:disabled`
`:active`
- [list of pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

Inheritance, Parent, Children

- to select children within a parent
  > ie. ul li a {}
  > selects all links within the lists within the unordered list

Div/Span

- both are used for grouping elements to be styled
  - `<div></div>`: mostly used to style as a block element, it also starts in a new line
  - `<span></span>`: mostly used to style as an inline element

Last Rule and Specificity

- last rule always applies but if the selector is specific, it will be applied

### Color Properties

- there are _140_ color names
  > "color: value;" sets the foreground color
  > "background-color: value;" sets  the background color
  > "background: color value;"

#### Color specification/format

1. **RGB** _(0-255)_

   > ie. color: rgb(255, 255, 255); === white

   - Opacity/Transparency _(0-1)_ or (00-ff) in hex
     > ie. background: rgba(r,g,b,0.5)
     - _a_ means _alpha_

2. **HEX Values** _(#RRGGBB)_

   - values are as follows:
     - 123456789 A(10) B(11) C(12) D(13) E(14) F(15)
       > ie. #FF0000 is Red and #00FF00 is Green

3. **HSL** (_Hue, Saturation, Light_)
   - _Hue_: measured in degrees of the color circle (0-360)
     - red = 0 degrees
     - green = 120 degrees
     - blue = 240 degrees
   - _Saturation_: Saturation percent (full saturation is 100%, 0% is shade of gray)
     - richness of color
     - refers to the amount of gray in a color
   - _Light_: lightness percent (100% is white, 50% is normal, 0% is black)

- [Random Color Palettes](coolors.co)

Contrast

- to ensure the legibility of text
- balance in color(light and dark) between the foreground and background color
  - Low Contrast: text is harder to read and affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screen.
  - High Contrast: text is easier to read but a lot of text with too much contrast makes it hard to read.
  - Medium Contrast: useful for long span of texts and it improves readability.
- [Contrast Checker](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html)

### CSS Properties and corresponding Units

#### Absolute value

- does not depend on anything (like size of screen or window)
- pixel or px
  > ie. font-size: 200px; width: 200px; height: 500px;

#### Relative value

- value will depend on the (value of) parent element

1. percentage or %

   > ie. width: 100%; height: 50%;

2. `em`

   - 1em = 16px --> default browser style
   - 1em is the base value
   - an `em` is equivalent to the width of the letter `m`.

3. `rem`

   - depends on the value of the root and not the parent
   - 1rem = 16px --> default browser style
   - 1rem is the base value

4. `vh`/`vw`

   - view height and view width
   - depends on the size of the screen (percent of the screen)
   - usually used in creating banners

Google Developer tools & Default browser styles

- Right click on page then click inspect

Calc Function (`calc()`)

- perform math operations
- mix and match values
- syntax: there should be a space in between operators

---

### **Typography**

`font-family` property

- adds a font style to a text

#### **Common Fonts**

Serif

- are the small features at the end of strokes within letters.
- easier to read than san-serif fonts in **print**.
- ie. _Garamond_

Sans-Serif

- without serif.
- describe fonts with characters which lack flourishes at the end of the strokes.
- often used to project an image of simplicity, modernity or minimalism.
- easier to read on smaller text.
- ie. _Helvetica_

Monospaced

- characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.
- many text editors use this font which aid in distinguishing between potentially similar characters (such as `I` and `1`) and in counting the number of characters in a line.
- ie. _Space Mono_

Web fonts

- multitude of different fonts on the web.
- can either import or copy and paste the code to the stylesheet
- Free font services: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/), [Font Squirrel](fontsquirrel.com), [Font Ex](fontex.org), [Open Font Library](openfontlibrary.org)
- Paid font services: [Fonts](fonts.com)
  - where you can download multiple fonts.
  - different font formats:
    - _OTF_ (OpenType Font)
    - _TTF_ (TrueType Font)
    - _WOFF_ (Web Open Font Format)
    - _WOFF2_ (Web Open Font Format 2)
  - `@font-face` can be used in CSS stylesheet to link to the relative path of the font file.

    ```css
    Syntax: @font-face {
              font-family: 'nameYouWant';
              src: url('path/fontName.woff2') format('woff2'), 
                   url('path/fontName.woff') format('woff'), 
                   url('path/fontName.ttf') format('ttf');
              }
    ```
  
  - the declared font name can then be used as value of the property `font-family`.

    ```css
    h1 {
      font-family: 'nameYouWant';
    }
    ```

- **Web safe fonts**: pre-installed fonts of browsers and OS.
  - ie. Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Brush Script M7.

`font-stack`

- adds multiple font style in case the browser doesn't support the selected font style
- it allows a generic font-family
  - such as serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy and monospaced

`font-weight`

- bold, normal, bolder, lighter
- numerical value: `1` (lightest) - `1000` (boldest) without units.
  - common practice is to use increments of `100`.
  - Itâ€™s important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font weight, and not all numeric font weights are available to all fonts.

`font-style`

- inherit, italic, normal, oblique

`text-transform`

- transforms text
- capitalize (capitalize first letter of all words), uppercase (capitalize all letters), lowercase (lower case all letters)

#### **Text Layout**

`text-align`

- aligns the text to its parent element.
- center, justify, left, right

`vertical-align`

- is not intended to align text in the middle of a block element but it does have this effect when used with table cells
- more commonly used with inline elements such as `img`, `em`, or `strong` elements.
- values: `baseline`, `sub`, `super`, `top`, `text-top`, `middle`, `bottom`, `text-bottom`.

`text-indent`

- indention of the text
- accepts multiple values such as px, em, rem, etc.

`line-height`

- _leading_: vertical space between(`ascender` and `descender`) lines of text.
- _descender_: part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline.
- _ascender_: highest point of a letter.
- controls the space in between the lines.
- can be unitless or a length value.
  - unitless number is preferred since it is responsive based on the current font size.

`letter-spacing`

- controls the spaces in between letters.
- _kerning_: space between each letter.

`word-spacing`

- controls the spaces in between words
- recommended unit is `em`.

`text-decoration`

- decorates the text
- none, line-through, overline, underline, blink, etc.

`text-shadow`

- used to create a _drop shadow_ or a dark version of the text behind it and slightly offset. (and _embossed effect_ or light version)
- values: right/left offset, bottom/top offset, blur, color

  ```css
  Syntax: p {
            text-shadow: 5px 5px 2px green;
          }
  ```

---

## CSS Box Model

> CONTENT >> PADDING >> BORDER >> MARGIN

### `padding`

- controls the padding or margin around the content
- distance from the content to the edge of the element
- `padding-top`,  `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`

  ```css
  Syntax:
  padding: value;  //padding size all around the element
  padding: top/bottom left/right; //ie. padding: 30px 50px;
  padding: top left/right bottom //ie. padding: 30px 50px 40px;
  padding: top right bottom left; //ie. padding: 30px 20px 50px 40px;
  ```

### `margin`

- distance from the screen or elements to the another element
- same syntax with the [padding](#padding)
- can be negative margin
- to make the element centered within the width of its element use `auto`. 
  - horizontal centering a block element
  - note that the width of the parent should be specified.
  
    ```css
    margin: auto;
    ```

- `vertical margin`: where top and bottom margins collapse or adds up between adjacent elements.

### `overflow`

- controls what happens to the content that spills or overflows outside its parent box or container.
- makes an image or other element be hidden when its size overflows from the given div or window

  ```css
  Syntax:
  body {
    overflow: hidden; // any content that overflows will be hidden from view. 
    overflow: scroll; //a scrollbar will be added to the elementâ€™s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.
    overflow: visible; //default value.
  }
  ```

### `visibility`

- hides elements from view.

  ```css
  Syntax:
  body {
    visibility: hidden;
    visibility: visible;
    visibility: collapse;
  }
  ```

### `box-sizing`

- controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting a web page.

  ```css
  * {
    box-sizing: content-box; //default; affected by border thickness and padding.
    box-sizing: border-box; //The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box
  }
  ```

### `border`

- border around the edge of an element
- `border-style`: style of the border
  - values are:
    - `solid`: a single solid line
    - `dotted`: a series of square dots
    - `dashed`: a series of short lines
    - `double`: two solid lines
    - `groove`: appears to be carved into the page
    - `ridge`: appears to stick out from the page
    - `inset`: appears to be embedded into the page
    - `outset`: looks like is is coming out of the screen
    - `hidden` or `none`: no border
- `border-width`: width of the border
- `border-color`: color of width
  
  ```css
  Syntax: 
  border: width style color;
  ```

- `border-radius`
  - changes the corners to round corners

`opacity:` property

- controls the transparency of an element
- the max value is 1 and minimum is 0

`visibility:` property

- controls the visibility of an element
- hidden or visible

---

### Outline

> CONTENT >> BORDER >> OUTLINE >> MARGIN

- same syntax with the border
- difference with border is the offset property
  - `outline-offset`: --> offsets the outline from the element

---

### Display Property (`display:`)

`block`

- always starts a new line and takes full width
- top/bottom margin is respected

`inline`

- does not start a new line and only take up as much as content space
- top/bottom margin is not respected

`inline-block`

- for the top/bottom margin to be respected and display the element in only one line

`none`

- does not display the element
- totally take out an element

`float:` property

- makes an image float
  - values: `left` or `right`
- moving an element as far left or as far right as possible in the container
- works for static and relative positioned elements.
- must have a _width specified_. Otherwise, the element will assume the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.

`clear:` property

- clear property makes the floating image be respected by the next element and will be left alone to the next line
  - values: 
    - `left`: the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
    - `right`: the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
    - `both`: neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.

---

### Position property (`position:`)

- can be offset by using _offset properties_:
  - `top:` , `right:`, `bottom:` , `left:`

`static`

- normal flow of the document as written in code.

`relative`

- sets the element's position relative to its original position.

`absolute`

- sets the element's position relative to the position of its ancestor element with a relative position property.

`fixed`

- set the element relative to the actual document.
- this fixes the element to its specific position.

`sticky`

- keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a specified position as the page is scrolled further.

`z-index`

- controls the z-axis (what's on top over the other ie. in multiple image overlays)
- default value is zero
- will only work if the position value is declared (`absolute` or `relative`); will not work if position is static

---

### Background property (`background:`)

background-repeat

- set by default
- values: `repeat`, `no-repeat`, `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, `space`, `round`

background-size

- values: `cover` (fills up the whole div regardless of its size);
  `contain` (keeps the ratio of the image); `auto`

background-position

- values: `center`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, percentage of x and y
  > ie. of percentage: background-position: 50% 50%;

background-attachment

- values: `fixed` (image is fixed giving the scroll effect);

linear-gradient()

- creates a gradient of colors
- default is from bottom to top
  > ie. linear-gradient(yellow, green, blue)
- from top to bottom
  > ie. linear-gradient(to top, yellow, green, blue)
- from left/right
  - change `to top` with `left`/`right`
- from a certain degrees
  > ie. linear-gradient(150deg, yellow, green, blue)
- can also include rgba values for the colors
  > ie. background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9));
- useful in overlaying background images for a clearer image
- search the net for: 'css linear generator' to generate different gradient combinations

>Syntax Shortcut for background property
>> background: `<linear-gradient(value, value)>` `<url(image location)>` `<position>`/`<size>` `<repeat value>` `<attachment value>`

```css
Example: 
  body {
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.2),rgba(0,0,0,0.2)), url("./images/big-image.jpeg") center/cover no-repeat fixed;
    }
```

---

### Media Queries

- allow us to work with responsive designs
- allow us to style elements depending on the screen size
- will use mostly: `min-width` and `max-width`
- starts with `@media`
  >ie. @media screen and (min-width: 576px) {
  >        `body` {
  >             background: red;
  >             }
  >        `.banner` {
  >             background: yellow;
  >             }
  >        `h1` {
  >             color: black;
  >           }
  >       `}
- syntax is very important for it to work!

---

## Pseudo Elements 

- acts like an extra element in the code.

`::before`/`::after` 

  ```css
  Syntax: element::before/::after {content: "";}
  ```

- content property should always have a value of `""`
- to add a content before/after another content
- does not work with images

`element::first-line`

- selects the first line of the element

`element::first-letter`

- selects the first letter of the element

**note**: `:` is used in classes while `::` is used in pseudo elements

## Pseudo Classes

- is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

 - see list of [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

`element:hover`

- changes the element as you hover over it

`element:link`

- set styles for all links that has not been visited.

`element:visited`

- changes/styles the links as it is visited or clicked

`element:hover`

- set styles over elements as you hover over it

`element:focus`

- applied when an element is in focus.

`element:active`

- styles are applied as the element is being activated by the user

`:root{}`

- styling the root element of the document
- it usually is the html element
- usually used in applying general styles and css variables

---

### Transform property (`transform:`)

- applies some type of transformation to the element (such as `translational` to x-,y-,z-axis, `rotation`, `scaling` and `skewing`)

#### Functions of transform property

`translateX();` , `translateY();` , `translateZ();` , `translate();`

- translates the element to desired value

`scaleX();` , `scaleY();` , `scaleZ();` , `scale();`

- controls the scaling of an element with respect to x, y or z axis

`rotateX();` , `rotateY();` , `rotateZ();` , `rotate();`

- rotates the element to a certain angle (in degrees) along x, y or z axis

`skewX();` , `skewY();` , `skewZ();` , `skew();`

- skews the element to a certain angle (in degrees) along x, y or z axis

### Transition (`transition:`)

- can add multiple values separated by a comma

`transition-duration:`

- sets the duration of the transition of an element
- can add multiple values separated by a comma

`transition-timing-function:`

- values
  - `ease` = slow start, fast, slow end (this is the default transition)
  - `linear` = same speed start to end
  - `ease-in` = slow start
  - `ease-out` = slow end
  - `ease-in-out` = slow start, fast, slow end

`transition-delay:`

- sets the duration of the delay of the transition of an element

__syntax shortcut__:
  > transition: `property 1` `duration value` `timing value` `delay duration value` , `property 2` `duration value` `timing value` `delay duration value` , and so on;
  > transition: `all` `duration value` `timing value` `delay duration value`; (for all Properties)

### Animation property (`animation:`)

- change over time with points
- syntax/selector: `@keyframes` `name` `{}`
- multiple points using percentage(ie. 0%, 1%,2%,3%,...)

#### Functions

`animation-name`

- selects the name designated for animation

`animation-duration`

- sets the duration of the animation (in s or ms)

`animation-iteration-count` (without Units)

- sets the number of times the animation will play (can be infinite)

`animation-fill-Mode`

- to get the values you end up with (forwards/backwards)

__syntax shortcut__

- animation: `name` `duration` `iteration count`

---

### CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

- holds a value and reuse it
- syntax: `--varName: value`
- property: `var(--varName)`
- can be used globally (through :root{}) or locally (by element)

---

- setting the height(to be flexible) to accommodate its content using `minmax()` function
  > ie. grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto)

`justify-items` / `align-items`

- similar to flexbox justify-content
- values are: start, end, center and default value is stretch

`justify-self` / `align-self`

- adjust individual elements

`grid-column` / `grid-row`

- sets the element to the designated span of rows or columns
  > ie. grid-column: 1/3; means start from 1st line and end in 3rd line

### Semantic vs. Non-semantic (`class`-naming)

Semantic

- descriptive
- doesn't convey their styles

Non-semantic

- more on specifying the style to use
  > ie. `<div class="bG-yellow"></div>`
- doesn't convey what an element represents

#### Why use Semantics?

1. Because they are readable.

2. Because they make it easier to build responsive sites.

3. Because they are easier to find.

4. Because they reduce the chance of regression.

5. Because visual classes aren't necessarily valuable.

6. Because they provide hooks for automated tests.

7. Because they provide hooks for JavaScript.

8. Because they need less maintaining.

9. Because they're easier to debug.

10. Because the standards recommend it.

11. Because styling state is easier.

12. Because they produce a small HTML footprint.
