lodash.js library
--> provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. 
--> If you wanted to use this library in your own projects right now, you could load it, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) link, in the <head> of your projectâ€™s index.html file , 

like so:

<head>
  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.20/lodash.min.js'></script>
  <!-- Make sure that you load lodash before the file that uses it. -->
  <script src='file-that-uses-lodash.js'></script>
</head>

---

Steps in implementing new methods in lodash
1. SPECIFY the functionality of the method we are implementing.
2. IDEATE a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code.
3. IMPLEMENT our game plan.
4. TEST our code to ensure it works as expected.
